* relaxed checking tolerances slightly to prevent spurious 'invalid 
  bandwidth' errors

* empty sections were removed from help files

* example(foobar) now works again [this was disabled in 0.14-1 to
  shorten duration of R CMD check - all examples remained in the help
  files but due to the presence of \dontrun{} they are not run when
  examples(foobar) is requested. Now a limited subset are run while
  the full set of examples remain]
