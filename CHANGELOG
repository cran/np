* Bandwidths are now checked for validity based on their variable and kernel 
  types
* np now does a better job of preserving names of some 'y' data
* Names of coefficients returned from coef() now match variable names
* Fixed some corner cases in npksum involving the dimensionality
  of ouputs
* Fixed deprecation warnings in R 2.5.0 caused by use of $ on atomic objects
* Various and sundry bug fixes in npscoef
* npscoef now handles discrete 'z' data
* Predict now accepts the argument 'se.fit', like predict.lm
* Fixed bug where incorrect asymptotic standard errors of gradients for 
  regression objects were being displayed in npplot()
* Fixed bug where errors of gradients of regression objects were not being
  returned in matrix form
* vcov() now works with partially linear regression objects 
* Fixed detection of evaluation responses when using the formula interface
* Pre-computed bandwidth objects are now provided for some of the more 
  computationally burdensome examples
* Added Jeffrey Wooldridge's WAGE1 dataset with qualitative variables (married, 
  female, nonwhite)
* Predictions outside of discrete support for regressions and conditional 
  densities are now allowed
* Fixed sign issue with scaling of standard errors in the single index model
* Fixed error when calculating some bandwidths/scale factors for display purposes
* Bug in passing certain arguments to npcdensbw fixed
* Added predict method for qregression objects
* Proper normalisation for liracine kernel shown in summary
* Fixed output bug (^H) in summary method for sigtest objects
* Fixed regression with plotting of bootstrapped errors in perspective plots
* npcdist no longer incorrectly calls npcdens
* Fixed spacing between var name and p-value in significance test summaries
